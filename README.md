##  What does it do?

This React application is a single page app that allow's users the ability to do the following:

* Interviews can be booked between Monday and Friday.
* A user can switch between weekdays.
* A user can book an interview in an empty appointment slot.
* Interviews are booked by typing in a student name and clicking on an interviewer from a list of available interviewers.
* A user can cancel an existing interview.
* A user can edit the details of an existing interview.
* The list of days informs the user how many slots are available for each day.
* The expected day updates the number of spots available when an interview is booked or canceled.
* A user is presented with a confirmation when they attempt to cancel an interview.
* A user is shown an error if an interview cannot be saved or deleted.
* A user is shown a status indicator while asynchronous operations are in progress.
* When the user presses the close button of the error they are returned to the Form or Show view (skipping Status and Confirm).
* The application makes API requests to load and persist data. We do not lose data after a browser refresh.

# Scheduler API

This API is to be run congruently to get the appropriate data to show on the main Scheduler App.



# Interview Scheduler API

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Creating The DB

Use the `psql -U development` command to login to the PostgreSQL server with the username `development` and the password `development`. This command **MUST** be run in a vagrant terminal, we are using the PostgreSQL installation provided in the vagrant environment.

Create a database with the command `CREATE DATABASE scheduler_development;`.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.development` and fill in the necessary PostgreSQL configuration. The `node-postgres` library uses these environment variables by default.

```
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=development
PGDATABASE=scheduler_development
PGPASSWORD=development
PGPORT=5432
```

## Seeding

Run a the development server with `npm start` in the Host environment. We are only using vagrant for `psql` this week.

Both of these achieve the same result.

* Make a `GET` request to `/api/debug/reset` with `curl http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset`.
* Use the browser to navigate to `http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset`.

The `development` data is random. Each time we seed we expect to see different appointments.

## Run The Server

Running the server normally

```sh
npm start
```

Running the server so it returns an error when saving/deleting for testing the client's error handling capabilities

```sh
npm run error
```
